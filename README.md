# Char_Counter_in_a_String
Small script to count and print the 3 most used characters in a Sentence (String)

This Script is in German, which means most comments and variables are German words, because I created this Script as an idea / inspiration for a friend. 
You are free to use it in your own code, change it and do whatever you want with it. I don't take credits or anything for it.
